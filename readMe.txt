The gui.exe file is under executable file/dist folder.

The dist folder contains the .exe file and 
the required dataset file.

The build, dist folder and the gui.spec 
file, all under the 'executable file' folder,
should be kept in the same place
for the gui.exe file to run.

gui.exe is a user interface that 
asks the user to input an image,
extract the features and 
predict the gender and age group.

The entire project code is under the code folder.
For executing the project codes, the software 
requirements are as follows:

1. Python v3.5.4
2. Following python packages:
 2.1  Scipy
 2.2  Numpy
 2.3  Matplotlib
 2.4  PIL
 2.5  Pandas Library
 2.6  Scikit-learn
 2.7  OpenCV

The gui.py file should be executed for 
getting the proper demonstration of our project.
